Brainstorming: Write down at least three ideas for datasets. Include as much information as possible about the availability of data.

Our team met on Zoom to discuss and brainstorm ideas for datasets. We wanted something that is relevent to our life and have a certain level of complecity that allow us to carefully analyze. Below are some of the dataset ideas that we talked about.

1. covid-19
This is a topic that all of us are interested in and is very relevent to our life right now. There are a few areas that we want to investigate, for instance, how many people wear mask and how it relates to their educational level; confirmed cases and regions; correlation between mortality rate and the strength of local healthcare system; government policy.

2. food preference - college students
College 15 is a concern for a lot of college students. We want to understand the reasons behind it and develop suggestions for students who are currently struggling this eating disroder. So, we want to look at students' food choices to find information about calories, veg types, nutritions, exercise level, gender, diets, and drinks. 

3. real and fake news
We interact with social media everyday, especially during this time when everyone is practising social distancing. There are a lot news about the covid-19, presidential election, and new policies showing up on our feeds. It is hard for the users to tell whether a news is true or not, so we want to investigate the % of fake news on selected social media; how many people believe it; what are some common topics; how fast can a fake news spread; what are some of the influences.

4. online shopping
Since all the malls and retail stores are closed right now. We are expecting to see a surge in online shopping. So, data about amount of users, user shopping behavior, regions, socioeconomic status, etc. would be exciting to analyze.
